#### This is my bachelor's project for the Advanced Programming course at Guilan University.

## In this project, we implemented a phonebook which has many features like:

1. Adding contacts with their attributes such as name, phone number, birthday, and etc.
1. Adding contacts in a special group like friends, family, etc...
1. Editing or removing contacts from the list after creation
1. Getting the contacts' coordinates and finding their neighbors based on calculating the circular perimeter

## How to run:
